<h2 style="color:Red"><strong><i>Personal Information</i></strong></h2>
<p>My name is <b>Mohamed Nur</b> , Im Somali/Eritrean ,18 years old and in addition to English
, I also speak Somali (which is my 1st language) . Currently I am studying bachelor of Information
 technology at Rmit University (City Campus) .I have completed Year 12 at Thornbury High School in 2019.
 Although I dont have a vast understanding of programming yet , in my spare time I like to play
 Video games , Soccer , Basketball and Workout </p>

<h2 style="color:Red" ><i><strong>Interest in It?</strong></i></h2>
<p>Although I dont have any It background knowledge , I think Information Technology would
be a good industry to build a career out of , which is why i chose to take on the bachelors degree.
 The fact that a-lot of businesses nowadays and even many of our daily activities relying on IT
 convinces me that the industry will be relevant in the future (Hopefully it'll grow even bigger)
 and the demand for qualified IT technicians will only rise exponentially , Hence more jobs :).


<h3 style="color:blue"><strong>Why did I chose to study at RMIT?</Strong> </h3>
 <p> After researching, I found RMIT to be a highly regarded university
 on the internet and by friends who already study here. It is also said to be ranked 21st
 in the world and 5th best university in Australia. Not to mention RMIT's strong industry
 connection , meaning it'll be easier for graduates (me) to find employment after studying
as RMIT is found attractive by most employers.</p>

<p> After attending many OPEN days at multiple universities throughout my last few years in High School
, I found Rmit to be one of the most modern (infrastructure-wise) and easier to navigate. Although
I'm not too fond of the location as I have to travel almost an hour everyday ive got a class, the Campus
is at-least located in the city , which is a good place to hang out with your friends after classes</p>

 <h3 style="color:blue">What do I expect to learn during my studies?<h3>
 <p><small>After not knowing what to expect of this course and attending my first few weeks of it ,
 I have grew an intrest in programming , so by the end of my studies at RMIT I would hope
  that Im a more capable programmer and that I can hopefully strengthen my programming
  skills. (PS-Not that I have any significant programming skills at the moment :-P)</small> </p>


<h2 style="color:Red"><i>My Ideal Job</i> </h2>
<p>Although Im unsure of what type of job I want to pursue as a career , I may be
interested in career as a Software developer. I think this job would fit me because
I can imagine myself enjoying to write code , solving problems or even develop programs.
I image below is a job offer that I may be interested in applying for in the future (After my studies) .</p>

<h3 style="color:blue"><strong>Why is this job appealing to me?</Strong> </h3>
<p>I think what makes this job appealing for me is that , in addition to working with other software engineers
 , I also get the opportunity to work with perhaps data scientists , marketing people and
support people. I think it' d  probably be cool to work with people from different fields
and consider their perspectives on different projects , while working together as a team
to create a product  which will eventually be delivered to normal everyday customers.

Another thing I think would be cool is that , when working with these different groups on a project , we will
always be learning from one another!</p>

<h3 style="color:blue"><strong>Skills and qualifications required for this position</Strong> </h3>
<p> I  understand that this position requires many skills and qualifications I dont have at this
point in time but hope to gain in the future and throughout my course. Some of these qualifications
include a Tertiary qualification in a computer science field (Already working on this), Advanced
knowledge of JavaScript ( Already Working on this) , Experience in UI development
 ( Already working on this 	)  and many more.  Some of these qualifications are already coming up
 in many of the classes im currently taking such as JavaScript , HTML , UX design in my first year classes (Im glad!).
 Interested to see how many qualifications i could gain by the time I finish my bachelors degree! </p>

<h2 style="color:Red"><i>My Profile</i></h2>
These 3 different tests gave me a better understanding of who I am as an individual and
shown me my strengths so I can use them to my advantage. They also revealed some of my weaknesses
so I could work on them. My <b style="color:Red"> learning styles </b> test showed that I was 3x more of a visual
learner than I was a Audiotory/Tactile learner and I somewhat do agree. Knowing this , perhaps
I could now implement this idea into my studying and hopefully it'll improve my studying habits
, aswell as enable me to study more efficiently. </p>

<p> I also have taken an online <b style="color:Red">Myers-Briggs</b> test and this test revealed that I was
an ISTJ , which identified me as a Logistician. The abbreviation ISTJ refers to the personality traits
I have , which consist of Introverted , Thinking , Judgement and Observant traits. Being a Logistician
Introvert means I like to spend my spare time alone instead of with others and that , Im strong-willed , work hard
and very responsible. This makes me a great team-mate to have as part of a group assignment as
according to the test I'm also very reliable. </p>

<p> In addition to the previous 2 tests , I also took a <b style="color:red"> Big 5 personality test</b> , this test was not
compulsory but in compliance with the Myers Briggs test reveled further traits of my personality.
I was ranked in the decently high  in the 2nd Category which identified me as being more Conscientious
than disorganised. ranking higher in the second category means that Im reliable , well-organised ,
self-disciplined and careful. All of which are traits that , I think my team-mates would appreciate while working with me </p>
